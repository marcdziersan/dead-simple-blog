# Draft Posts

Draft posts can be put in this folder, they will not be included in the listing of posts until they are moved up into the parent folder.

**Important:** Permissions on this folder are set to User Read/Write ONLY, which will prevent the general public from accessing the text files directly. But beware, if these folder permissions are overwritten then those files will be viewable.

I will probably do up some Apache and nginx configurations that will secure this in a more reliable way, but in the meantime if you're not sure, you can always save your drafts offline.
